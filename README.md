# 👨🏾‍💻 SouthWarri-Dev

### Hey there, I'm Shedrack Erhabor — aka **The Tech Guy from South Warri**  
_Coder by day, hacker by night, future builder 24/7._

## 🧠 What I Do  
I build clean, scalable systems using modern tech — and sometimes ancient magic.

- ⚙️ **Full Stack Dev** — TypeScript • Node.js • React Native • Supabase • PostgreSQL  
- 🐍 **Python Wizardry** — AI, scripting, scraping, and automation  
- 🧬 **Quantum Programmer** — Tapping into Qubits & multi-state logic  
- 🧱 **C Language Architect** — Working on my own OS from scratch (no fluff, just fire)  
- 🛠️ **Ethical Hacker** — Pen-testing, digital defense, code as shield

---

## 🧘🏾‍♂️ Philosophy  
I don’t just build apps — I build **systems for the future**.  
From **The Eternal Now** to **Internet Nashedy**, my code is rooted in ideas that stretch beyond time, beyond hardware.

🪐 *"If you can imagine it, you can architect it."*
